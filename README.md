A Python script to export your Steam wishlist.

> :warning: Provided as-is, use at your own risk.

Only tested on Linux.

# Usage
* Download the script `steam_wishlist.py` and run it with a recent version of Python 3. 
* Supply your 17 digit [SteamID](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/2816-BE67-5B69-0FEC) ([Tool](https://steamdb.info/calculator/)):

``` shell
python3 steam_wishlist.py <steamID>
```

# Private wishlist
If your wishlist is private, you'll have to take a few extra steps:
* Log in to your Steam account with your browser.
* Copy the value of the `steamLoginSecure` cookie. This value is a long string starting with `76561198` followed by a lot of random letters and numbers.
* Supply the value of that cookie to `steam_wishlist.py` with the `-c` parameter:

``` shell
python3 steam_wishlist.py -c <steamLoginSecure cookie> <steamID>
```

The `steamLoginSecure` cookie regularly expires/changes, so you'll have to repeat this process every time you run steam_wislist.py. 
**Never share or publish your `steamLoginSecure` cookie!**

# Output
The wishlist is written to stdout. By default `steam_wishlist.py` will output JSON. Use the `--csv` option to have it output [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
instead. The default separator for CSV is TAB and can be changed with the `-s/--separator` option. The `-f/--fields` argument can be used to specify which fields to output. For example:

``` shell
python3 steam_wishlist.py <steamID> --csv -f gameid,type,name
```

Example output:

``` text
581300  Game    Black Mirror
582890  Game    Estranged: The Departure
865670  DLC     Prey - Mooncras
591380  Game    Bomb Squad Academy
593380  DLC     XCOM 2: War of the Chosen
```
